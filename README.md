- 📄 Know about my experiences [For six years, I was part of the E-sports world as a professional player and administrative assistant—an experience that taught me discipline, the ability to work under pressure, performance analysis, and results-driven decision-making. Experiencing competition from the inside sparked a strong curiosity to understand the data behind performance: the metrics that explain success and the patterns that make the difference. This interest led me to make a conscious career shift and train as a Junior Data Analyst. Today, I combine my background in competitive environments with skills in data analysis, data interpretation, and analytical thinking, aiming to transform data into clear and actionable insights. I am especially motivated to apply data analysis in industries such as sports, gaming, E-sports, and technology, where performance and strategy increasingly depend on data. My goal is to continue growing as an analyst, contribute to impactful projects, and demonstrate that when data is properly understood, it can make a real difference—both inside and outside of competition.](For six years, I was part of the E-sports world as a professional player and administrative assistant—an experience that taught me discipline, the ability to work under pressure, performance analysis, and results-driven decision-making.
